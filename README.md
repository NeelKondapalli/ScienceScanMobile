App Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7F8yq35nVAhGP8x72rV92MBtJJhKLB1/view?usp=sharing

This is the public demo repo for the ScienceScan app, developed for TetraScience. This app presents users with experimental tasks and samples, and gives them the ability to scan readings with AI and generate video, image, and audio media to accompany experiments. This project is still being developed. 

If you are a potential employer, and you are interested in seeing my code, please message me @ neel2h06@gmail.com.
